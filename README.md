**Work In Progress**
This is the start of a personal website with my own CMS for adding projects and eventually blog articles (using a firebase database). 

Have not done much UX work on this.

You will need to sign up: you can use a fake email and a generic password.
Once signed up you will be redirected to the dashboard. You can view projects, blogs and create them. This is all just dummy data at the moment.

If you are creating a post I recommend using somethign like [html-online](https://html-online.com/editor/) to easily get HTML (for the content input) - stick to jsut using paragraphs (p tags) i havent tested beyond that).

###Stack
React, Node.js, redux, firestore/firebase(NoSQL).
