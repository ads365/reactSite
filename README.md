**Work In Progress**
This is the start of a personal website with my own CMS for adding projects and eventually blog articles (using a firebase database). 

Authentication is incomplete (sign up and permissioned pages).

Have not done any UX work on this.

You will need to sign up: you can use a fake email and a generic password.
Once signed up you will be redirected to the dashboard. You can view projects and create projects. This is all just dummy data at the moment and as stated above UX hasn't been done yet.
