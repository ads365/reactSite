**Work In Progress**
This is the start of a personal website with my own CMS for adding projects, blog articles and handling messages (using a firebase database). 

Have not done much UX work on this.

### [https://mysiteapp-97d5a.web.app/](https://mysiteapp-97d5a.web.app/)

You can sign up: you can use a fake email and a generic password.
(or use test@test.com for email and password: "password" to log in.
Once signed up you will be redirected to the dashboard. You can view projects, blogs and create them. This is all just dummy data at the moment.

If you are creating a post I recommend using something like [html-online](https://html-online.com/editor/) to easily get **HTML** (**Only For "Content" Input**) - stick to just using paragraphs (p tags) i haven't tested beyond that.

### Stack
React, Node.js, redux, firestore/firebase(NoSQL).
